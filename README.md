# Bank Managment System
The Bank Management System (BMS) aims to streamline banking operations and enhance customer service. The project's primary objective is to develop, implement, and maintain a robust BMS to improve efficiency, accuracy, and transparency in managing banking operations and customer interactions.
User creation, transfer of money and e-statement modules have been created and implemented successfully.
The demo directory must be executed independently to generate e-statements, as it encompasses a distinct set of files and functionalities.
